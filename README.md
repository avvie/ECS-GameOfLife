# ECS-GameOfLife
Implementing the Game of Life by Conway. Trying to learn ECS and data driven thinking

# How to Use
Well you download the project. 

In the assets folder is a bitmap. below is the sample in the project. Looks small but 100x100 in unity coords is quite large
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avvie/ECS-GameOfLife/master/Assets/osci.bmp)

take that BITMAP into paint or something and paint the initial positions

open the project up in unity and click play.

# Important
The size of the canvas is defined by the bitmap
the outer ring of the canvas is not computed
